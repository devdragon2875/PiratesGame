# Pirates README
Anantajit Subrahmanya, Devansh Mishra, and Blake Randle

## Introduction
Do you enjoy games that make you filthy rich, but have no effect on the real world? Do you get sadistic pleasure when you destroy something someone has been upgrading for hours? Well, Pirates will provide just that. Starting off with some basic supplies, you must venture out into a new world and cleverly trade items with the local merchants in order to gain gold. But be careful! There are others, those who are as bloodthirsty and ruthless as you are, who want to trade with the local merchants. You must fight your way through enemy ships and utilize your gold to upgrade your ship in order to survive the ruthless seas. Welcome to the world of Piratesâ€¦

## Instructions

### Start

Click the START button or press ENTER to continue

### Setup 

Type in the Server code in the textbox, and click the CONNECT button to start the game. An overview of the game play is provided in the panel below the game.

### Gameplay

The boat with a triangle above it is your boat. You can control the rowing speed of the boat with the W/UP and S/DOWN keys. The rudder can be 
controled by the A/LEFT and D/RIGHT keys. Pressing the 'M' key triggers Map subview, explained later in the README.

At the top-right corner of the screen is the options button. This leads to the Options subview, to be discussed later in this README.

### Comments
1) Need a class list in the README.
2) Player is an Enemy? That seem confusing. Maybe have one superclass for both player and enemy (e.x. sprite).
3) Networking isn't in the UML diamgram.  You should figure that out if you want to have it be a main part of the game.
4)A lot of mention of upgrading all your ships and things but no mention of saving your progress, just something to think about.
